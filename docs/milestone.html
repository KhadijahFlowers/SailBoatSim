              <h2 align="left">Overview of Accomplishments</h2>
              <p>
                  So far, we have laid the ground works for each of the aspects of our project. We designed our GUI with all the components 
                  we need to manipulate the sailboat. This includes changing the boat type apperance, altering the wind speed and sun light 
                  amounts, and changing the density frame/s of simulation rendering. We have also added in the keyboard commands to move the
                  sailboat around in the North, South, East, West directions.
              </p>
              <p>
                  The next part we have accomplished is designing our boat, sail, and water plane. The boat was created using OpenGL.
                  The sail is able to move with the wind so
                  if we increase the wind intensity, the sail will puff out more and flap around less. The water plane is created by
                  having a normal plane and adding a shader on top of it to project the feeling of water.
              </p>
              <p>
                  summarize what you have accomplished,
                  preliminary results,
              </p>
              <h2 align="left">Progress and Plan Updates</h2>
              <p>
                  Our working schedule plan changed. Instead of working on one part at a time each week, we divided up the parts and are each
                  tackling one of the parts.
              </p>
              <p>
                  We also changed the scope of the project. Based on feedback from the project proposal, we decided that we will focus on 
                  the motion, sail, and wind simulator. For the water simulator, we are instead using a shader to give it the water texture. To 
                  create the water movement, we are going to make it like the pinned cloth and have the water cloth move accordingly to the
                  amount of wind.
